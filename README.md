<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

LinkingPark is a browser tab manager with a difference. On loading it up, you enter an interactive 2d world (think Pokemon or Zelda) and can explore to your hearts content. When you're ready you can add tabs to all the points of interest and open them just when you need them.

- Manages browser tabs for your default browser.
- Easily add, delete and change your favourite tab groups.
- Load up tabs as and when you need them.
- Improve productivity by making changing tabs a deliberate choice.

Key Points:

- Written in ReactJS using TypeScript.
- GSAP for animation & SASS for styling.
- KaboomJS for canvas game creation and interactivity.
- NodeJS for database access and routing.
- mySQL for database management and queries.

If you have any tools or additions you would like to see included in LinkingPark, let me know via the links above! :)
